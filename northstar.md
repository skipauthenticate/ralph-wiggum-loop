# Northstar

## Vision
[What does success look like when this project is done?]

## Guiding Principles
- [Principle 1: e.g. "Privacy first — all data stays on-device"]
- [Principle 2: e.g. "Resource-aware — runs on Jetson Orin Nano"]
- [Principle 3: e.g. "Simple over clever — prefer readable code"]
- Fight entropy — leave the codebase better than you found it

## Non-Goals
- [What this project explicitly does NOT try to do]

## Quality Bar

### Repo Type: [prototype / production / library]
- **Prototype**: speed over perfection — shortcuts acceptable
- **Production**: must be maintainable — best practices enforced
- **Library**: backward compatibility matters — no breaking changes

### Standards
- [Test coverage target, e.g. "pytest coverage > 80%"]
- [Linting, e.g. "All code must pass ruff check + ruff format"]
- [Types, e.g. "mypy --strict must pass"]
- Never remove or weaken existing tests
- All feedback loops must pass before any commit
