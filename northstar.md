# Northstar

## Vision
[What does success look like when this project is done?]

## Guiding Principles
- [Principle 1: e.g. "Privacy first — all data stays on-device"]
- [Principle 2: e.g. "Resource-aware — runs on Jetson Orin Nano"]
- [Principle 3: e.g. "Simple over clever — prefer readable code"]

## Non-Goals
- [What this project explicitly does NOT try to do]

## Quality Bar
- [Test coverage, linting, performance requirements]
- [e.g. "All code must pass black + isort + flake8"]
- [e.g. "pytest coverage > 80%"]
